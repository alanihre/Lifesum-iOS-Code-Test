# Lifesum iOS Code Test
### By Alan Ihre
This is a repository with the code for a programming test for Lifesum for iOS.

The app asynchronously imports three JSON files and displays the data. The user can also search among the data.

Third party libraries used in the app are:<br />
[SVProgressHUD](https://github.com/TransitApp/SVProgressHUD)<br />
[BLKFlexibleHeightBar](https://github.com/bryankeller/BLKFlexibleHeightBar)<br />
[EDStarRating](https://github.com/erndev/EDStarRating)<br />
[PNChart](https://github.com/kevinzhow/PNChart)<br />
[UICountingLabel](https://github.com/kevinzhow/PNChart) (not actually used but required by PNChart)
